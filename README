NAME

list_versions.pl - "easify" writing Makefile.PL and Build.PL by
easily listing versions of modules.

DESCRIPTION

This is a tiny script that takes module names as command
line arguments and prints the versions installed in a format suitable
for copy/pasting into Build.PL or Makefile.PL as well as
basic use_ok() test for each of them to include in Test::More
tests.

USAGE

    list_versions.pl Carp URI LWP::UserAgent Some::OtherModule LWP
